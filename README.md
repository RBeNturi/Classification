# AI Data Classification
AI data classification is the process of **organizing data into categories** to improve the efficiency of working with that data.
It involves **categorizing data into predefined classes or labels** using machine learning algorithms that learn from patterns in historical data.
## This Repo
Contains Python code that uses in machine learning for classification with the Iris dataset. 
The dataset contains three classes of flowers - Versicolor, Setosa, and Virginica - and each class contains four features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width. 
The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
