# 🤖 AI Data Classification 📊

AI data classification is the magical process of **organizing data into categories** 🗂️ to supercharge the efficiency of working with that data. It's all about **categorizing data into predefined classes or labels** 🏷️ using machine learning algorithms that learn from patterns in historical data. 🧠💡

## 📁 This Repo

This repository contains Python 🐍 code that uses machine learning for classification with the Iris dataset. 🌸

The dataset contains three classes of flowers - Versicolor, Setosa, and Virginica - and each class contains four features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width. 🌺🌼🌷

The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features. So, let's dive in and explore the world of AI data classification! 🚀
